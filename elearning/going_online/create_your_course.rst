Create your course
==================

The Odoo eLearning application allows you to create courses and get them online and running in minutes thanks to the
friendly Odoo interface. Online learning has been on the rise in recent years, and itâ€™s not really hard to see why.
eLearning courses are more convenient than traditional face to face courses. Students can fit them around their existing
responsibilities and commitments, allowing them to engage with content and extra learning materials whenever is most
convenient to them.

======================

Go to :menuselection:`eLearning --> Dashboard`. The course overview is the default dashboard for the eLearning
Application. You can also access course creation via :menuselection:`eLearning --> Courses --> Courses`.
